# Coding-Challenge Frontend


## Task
Build a website for exploring the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation)  and present it to our team. We encourage you to use the [GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql), but if you have big struggles using GraphQL you can fall back to the [REST-API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest).

The website should include:
 - A **Character-Overview** of all characters
	 -  (with links to Character-Details)
 - An **Episode-Overview** of all episodes
	 -  (with links to Episode-Details)
 - A **Character-Details-Page** for each character
	 - Overview of all episodes with this character
	 - (with links to Episode-Details)
 - An **Episode-Details-Page** for each episode
	 - Overview of all characters in this episode
	 - (with links to Character-Details)
 - **Mark a character as favorite**
	 - Favorite characters should display a ❤️ in every view

You should plan to invest about **6 hours** to complete the challenge.
